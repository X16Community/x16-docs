# Appendix B: Official Expansion Cards

This is just a stub as a proposal for how to document official expansion cards
(those made by the core X16 team)

## Serial/MIDI UART/Wavetable Expansion Card

Kevin is desinging a UART expansion card which is capable of supporting standard serial
as well as MIDI and a wavetable add on card. It uses the Texas Instruments TL16C2550[^1].

As the card is still in development there are not any demos or code examples available,
though the datasheet contains informaiton on how to set things up (see below). Kevin
also provied some information[^2] on how to setup the card in his original announcement
on the community Discord.
