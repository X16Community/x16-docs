# 13: Working With CMDR-DOS

This manual describes Commodore DOS on FAT32, aka CMDR-DOS.

## CMDR-DOS

Commander X16 duplicates and extends the programming interface used by Commodore's line of disk drives, including the
famous (or infamous) VIC-1541. CMDR-DOS uses the industry-standard FAT-32 format. Partitions can be 32MB up to
(in theory) 2TB and supports CMD-style partitions, subdirectories, timestamps and filenames up to 255 characters.
It is the DOS built into the [Commander X16](https://www.commanderx16.com).

There are three basic interfaces for CMDR-DOS: the binary interface (LOAD, SAVE, etc.), the data file interface (OPEN,
PRINT#, INPUT#, GET#), and the command interface. We will give a brief summary of BASIC commands here, but please refer
to  [Chapter 4: BASIC Programming](X16%20Reference%20-%2004%20-%20BASIC.md#chapter-4-basic-programming) for full syntax of each command.

If you are familiar with the SD2IEC or the CMD hard drive, navigating partitions and subdirectories is similar, with "CD", "MD", and "RD" commands
to navigate directories.

## Binary Load/Save

The primary use of the binary interface is loading and saving program files and loading binary files into RAM.

Your binary commands are LOAD, SAVE, BLOAD, VLOAD, BVLOAD, VERIFY, and BVERIFY.

This is a brief summary of the LOAD and SAVE commands. For full documentation, refer to [Chapter 4: BASIC Programming](X16%20Reference%20-%2004%20-%20BASIC.md#chapter-4-basic-programming).

### LOAD

`LOAD <filename> [,device][,secondary_address]`
`LOAD <filename> [,device][,ram_bank,start_address]`

This reads a program file from disk. The first two bytes of the file are the memory location to which the file will be
loaded, with the low byte first. BASIC programs will start with $01 $08, which translates to $0801, the start of BASIC
memory.
The device number should be 8 for reading from the SD card.

If using the first form, secondary_address has multiple meanings:

* 0 or not present: load the data to address $0801, regardless of the address header.

* 1: load to the address specified in the file's header

* 2: load the file headerless to the location $0801.

If using the second form, ram_bank sets the bank for the load, and start_address is the location to read your data into.

The value of the ram_bank argument only affects the load when the start_address is set in the range of \$A000-\$BFFF.

Examples:

`LOAD "ROBOTS.PRG",8,1` loads the program "ROBOTS.PRG" into memory at the address encoded in the file.

`LOAD "HELLO",8` loads a program to the start of BASIC at $0801.

`LOAD "*",8,1` loads the first program in the current directory. See the section below on wildcards for more
information about using * and ? to access files of a certain type or with unprintable characters.

`LOAD "DATA.BIN",8,1,$A000` loads a file into banked RAM, RAM bank 1, starting at $A000. The first two bytes of the file are skipped. To avoid skipping the first two bytes, use the `BLOAD` command instead.

### SAVE

`SAVE <filename>[,device]`

Saves a file from the computer to the SD card. SAVE always reads from the beginning of BASIC memory at $0801, up to the
end of the BASIC program. Device is optional and defaults to 8 (the SD card, or an IEC disk drive, if one is plugged in.)

One word of caution: CMDR-DOS will not let you overwrite a file by default. To overwrite a file, you need to prefix
the filename with @:, like this:

`SAVE "@:DEMO.PRG"`

### BSAVE

`BSAVE <filename>,<device>,<ram_bank>,<start_address>,<end_address>`

Saves an arbitrary region of memory to a file without a two-byte header. To allow concatenating multiple regions of RAM into a single file with multiple successive calls to BSAVE, BSAVE allows the use of append mode in the filename string. To make use of this option, the first call to BSAVE can be called normally, which creates the file anew, while subsequent calls should be in append mode to the same file.

Another way to save arbitrary binary data from arbitrary locations is to use the S command in the MONITOR: [Chapter 7: Machine Language Monitor](X16%20Reference%20-%2007%20-%20Machine%20Language%20Monitor.md#chapter-7-machine-language-monitor).

`S "filename",8,<start_address>,<end_address>`

Where <start_address> and <end_address> are a 16-bit hexadecimal address.

After a SAVE or BSAVE, the DOS command is implicitly run to show the drive status. The Commodore file I/O model does not report certain failures back to BASIC, so you should double-check the result after a write operation.

```BASIC
00, OK,00,00

READY.
```

An OK reply means the file saved correctly. Any other result is an error that should be addressed:

```BASIC
63,FILE EXISTS,00,00
```

CMDR-DOS does not allow files to be overwritten without special handling. If you get FILE EXISTS, either change your file's name or save it with the @: prefix, like this:

`SAVE "@:HELLO"`

### BLOAD

BLOAD loads a file _without an address header_ to an arbitrary location in memory. Usage is similar to LOAD. However, BLOAD does not require
or use the 2-byte header. The first byte in the file is the first byte loaded into memory.

`BLOAD "filename",8,<ram_bank>,<start_address>`

### VLOAD

Read binary data into VERA. VLOAD skips the 2-byte address header and starts reading at the third byte of the file.

`VLOAD "filename",8,<vram_bank>,<start_address>`

### BVLOAD

Read binary data into VERA without a header. This works like BLOAD, but into VERA RAM.

`BVLOAD "filename",8,<vram_bank>,<start_address>`

### DOS WEDGE

The DOS wedge allows you to issue quick commands from BASIC with the > or @
symbol.

| Command | Action |
|-|-|
| `/<filename>` | Load a BASIC program into RAM |
| `%<filename>` | Load a machine language program into RAM (like `,8,1`) |
| `↑<filename>` | Load a BASIC program into RAM and then unconditionally run it |
| `←<filename>` | Save a BASIC program to disk |
| `@` | Display (and clear) the disk drive status |
| `@$` | Display the disk directory without overwriting the BASIC program in memory |
| `@#<device number>` | Change default DOS device |
| `@<command>` | Execute a disk drive command (e.g. `@S0:<filename>`) |
| `><command>` | Execute a disk drive command (e.g. `>CD:<dir>`) |

## Sequential Files

Sequential files have two basic modes: read and write. The OPEN command opens a file for reading or writing. The PRINT# command writes to a file, and the GET# and INPUT# commands read from the file.

todo: examples

## Command Channel

The command channel allows you to send commands to the CMDR-DOS interface. You can open and write to the command channel using the OPEN command, or you can use the DOS command to issue commands and read the status. While DOS can be used in immediate mode or in a program, only the combination of OPEN/INPUT# can read the command response back into a variable for later processing.

In either case, the ST psuedo-variable will allow you to quickly check the status. A status of 64 is "okay", and any
other value should be checked by reading the error channel (shown below.)

To open the command channel, you can use the OPEN command with secondary address 15.

`10 OPEN 15,8,15`

If you want to issue a command immediately, add your command string at the end of the OPEN statement:

`10 OPEN 15,8,15, "CD:/"`

This example changes to the root directory of your SD card.

To know whether the OPEN command succeeded, you must open the command channel and read the result. To read the command channel (and clear the error status if an error occurred), you need to read four values:

`20 INPUT#15,A,B$,C,D`

A is the error number. B$ is the error message. C and D are unused in CMDR-DOS for most responses, but will return the track and sector when used with a disk drive on the IEC connector.

```BASIC
30 PRINT A;B$;C;D
40 CLOSE 15
```

So the entire program looks like:

```BASIC
10 OPEN 15,8,15, "CD:/"
20 INPUT#15,A,B$,C,D
30 PRINT A;B$;C;D
40 CLOSE 15
```

If the error number (`A`) is less than 20, no error occurred. Usually this result is 0 (or 00) for OK.

You can also use the DOS command to send a command to CMDR-DOS. Entering DOS by itself will print the drive's status on the screen. Entering a command in quotes or a string variable will execute the command. We will talk more about the status variable and DOS status message in the next section.

```BASIC
DOS
00, 0K, 00, 00
READY.
DOS "CD:/"
```

The special case of `DOS "$"` will print a directory listing.

`DOS "$"`

You can also read the name of the current directory with DOS"$=C"

`DOS "$=C"`

## DOS Features

This is the base features set compared to other Commodore DOS devices:

| Feature          | 1541 | 1571/1581 | CMD HD/FD | SD2IEC   | _CMDR-DOS_      |

| Code execution   | yes  | yes       | yes       | no       | yes             |
| Burst commands   | no   | yes       | yes       | no       | no              |
| Timestamps       | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | yes             |
| Time API         | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | not yet         |
| Partitions       | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | yes             |
| Subdirectories   | no   | no        | yes       | yes      | yes             |

It consists of the following components:

* Commodore DOS interface
  * `dos/main.s`: TALK/LISTEN dispatching
  * `dos/parser.s`: filename/path parsing
  * `dos/cmdch.s`: command channel parsing, status messages
  * `dos/file.s`: file read/write
* FAT32 interface
  * `dos/match.s`: FAT32 character set conversion, wildcard matching
  * `dos/dir.s`: FAT32 directory listing
  * `dos/function.s`: command implementations for FAT32
* FAT32 implementation
  * `fat32/*`: [FAT32 for 65c02 library](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-rom/tree/master/fat32)

All currently unsupported commands are decoded in `cmdch.s` anyway, but hooked into `31,SYNTAX ERROR,00,00`, so adding features should be as easy as adding the implementation.

CMDR-DOS implements the TALK/LISTEN layer (Commodore Peripheral Bus layer 3), it can therefore be directly hooked up to the Commodore IEEE KERNAL API (`talk`, `tksa`, `untlk`, `listn`, `secnd`, `unlsn`, `acptr`, `ciout`) and be used as a computer-based DOS, like on the C65 and the X16.

CMDR-DOS does not contain a layer 2 implementation, i.e. IEEE-488 (PET) or Commodore Serial (C64, C128, ...). By adding a Commodore Serial (aka "IEC") implementation, CMDR-DOS could be adapted for use as the system software of a standalone 65c02-based Serial device for Commodore computers, similar to an sd2iec device.

The Commodore DOS side and the FAT32 side are well separated, so a lot of code could be reused for a DOS that uses a different filesystem.

* <sup>1</sup>: outdated API, not useful, or can't be supported on FAT32
* <sup>2</sup>: is a no-op, returns `00, OK,00,00`
* <sup>3</sup>: third argument `FAT32` _has_ to be passed
* <sup>4</sup>: CMDR-DOS was architected to run on the main computer, so it shouldn't be DOS that keeps track of the time
* <sup>5</sup>: Instead of testing the ROM, this command currently verifies that no buffers are allocated, otherwise it halts. This is used by unit tests to detect leaks.
* <sup>6</sup>: Repurposed for SD card read and write mode. _flag_ selects whether fast read (auto_tx) and fast writes are enabled. 0=none, 1=auto_tx, 2=fast writes, 3=both

The following special file syntax and `OPEN` options are specific to CMDR-DOS:

| Feature               | Syntax      | Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open for Read & Write | `,?,M`      | Allows arbitrarily reading, writing and setting the position (`P`)<sup>7</sup> |
| Get current working directory | `$=C` | Produces a directory listing containing the name of the current working directory followed by all parent directory names all the way up to `/` |

* <sup>7</sup>: once the EOF has been reached while reading, no further reads or writes are possible.

The following added command channel features are specific to CMDR-DOS:

| Feature               | Syntax      | Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POSITION              | `P` _channel_ _p0_ _p1_ _p2_ _p3_  | Set position within file (like sd2iec); all args binary |
| TELL<sup>8</sup>                  | `T` _channel_ | Return the current position within a file and the file's size; channel arg is binary |

* <sup>8</sup>: available in ROM version R48 and later

To use the POSITION and TELL commands, you need to open two channels: a data channel and the command channel. The _channel_ argument should be the same as the secondary address of the data channel.

If POSITION succeeds, `00, OK,00,00` is returned on the command channel.

If TELL succeeds, `07,pppppppp ssssssss,00,00` is returned on the command channel, where `pppppppp` is a hexadecimal representation of the position, and `ssssssss` is a hexadecimal represenation of the file's size.

### Examples

```BASIC
OPEN 1,8,2,"LEVEL.DAT,S,R"
OPEN 15,8,15,"P"+CHR$(2)+CHR$(0)+CHR$(1)+CHR$(0)+CHR$(0)
```

The above opens LEVEL.DAT for reading and positions the read/write pointer at byte 256.

```BASIC
10 OPEN 2,8,5,"LEVEL.DAT,S,R"
20 OPEN 15,8,15,"T"+CHR$(5)
30 INPUT#15,A,A$,T,S
40 CLOSE 15
50 IF A>=20 THEN 90
60 SZ=VAL("$"+MID$(A$,9))
70 PRINT "SIZE=";SZ
80 GOTO 100
90 PRINT"ERROR"
100 CLOSE 2
```

This time, the secondary address is 5, and we're fetching only the file's size.

### Current Working Directory

The $=C command will list the current working directory and its parent path. The current directory will be at the top of the listing, with each parent
directory beneath, with / at the bottom.

```BASIC
DOS"$=C"

0 "/TEST            "
0    "TEST"             DIR
0    "/"                DIR
65535 BLOCKS FREE.
```
