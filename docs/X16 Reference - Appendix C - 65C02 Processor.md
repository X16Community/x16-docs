# Appendix C: The 65C02 Processor

This is not meant to be a complete manual on the 65C02 processor, though is
meant to serve as a convenient quick reference. Much of this information comes
from 6502.org and pagetable.com. It is been placed here for convenience though
further information can be found at those (and other) sources.

## Overview

The WDC65C02 CPU is a modern version of the MOS6502 with a few additional
instructions and addressing modes and is capable of running at up to 14 MHz. On
the Commander X16, it is clocked at 8 MHz.

## A note about 65C816 Compatibilty

The Commander X16 may be upgraded at some point to use the WDC 65C816 CPU.
The 65C816 is mostly compatible with the 65C02, except for 4 instructions
(`BBRx`, `BBSx`, `RMBx`, and `SMBx`).

These instructions *may* be deprecated in a future release of the emulator, and
so we suggest not using these instructions. Some people are already using the
65C816 in their X16 systems, and so using these instructions will cause your
programs to malfunction on these computers.

ADC ($20)    ZP Indirect    $72   2     5     NV----ZC +c
```

Add a number to the Accumulator and stores the result in A.

Use the Carry (C) or Overflow (V) flags to determine whether the result was too
large for an 8 bit number.

If C is set before operation, then 1 will be added to the result.

C is set when result is more than 255 ($FF)  
Z is set when result is zero  
V is set when signed result is too large. (Goes below -128 or above 127).  
N is set when result is negative (bit 7=1)  

+p: Add 1 cycle if a page boundary is crossed when forming address.  
+c: New for the 65C02

```

Bitwise AND the provided value with the Accumulator.

- Sets N (Negative) flag if the bit 7 of the result is 1, and otherewise
clears it.
- Sets Z (Zero) is the result is zero, and otherwise clears it  

`AND #$FF` will leave A unaffected (but still set the flags).  
`AND #$00` will clear A.  
`AND #$0F` will clear the high nibble of A, leaving a value of $00 to $0F
in A.

ASL $8080,X  Absolute,X     $1E   3     6+    N-----ZC +p
```

Shifts all bits to the left by one position, moving 0 into the low bit.

0 is shifted into bit 0.  
Bit 7 is shifted to Carry.  

**Similar instructions:**  
[LSR](#lsr) is the opposite instruction and shifts to the right.  
[ROL](#rol) shifts left through Carry.

+p: Add 1 cycle if a page boundary is crossed when forming address.

```text
SYNTAX       MODE           HEX  LEN  CYCLES  FLAGS    
BBR0 $20,$8080 ZP Relative    $0F   3     5     -------- +c -816
BBR1 $20,$8080 ZP Relative    $1F   3     5     -------- +c -816

BBR4 $20,$8080 ZP Relative    $4F   3     5     -------- +c -816
BBR5 $20,$8080 ZP Relative    $5F   3     5     -------- +c -816
BBR6 $20,$8080 ZP Relative    $6F   3     5     -------- +c -816
BBR7 $20,$8080 ZP Relative    $7F   3     5     -------- +c -816
```

Branch to LABEL if bit x of zero page address is 0 where x is the number of the
specific bit (0-7).

+c: New for the 65C02
-816: *Not available* on the 65C816  

#### BBR Example

```asm
  check_flag:
    BBR3 zeropage_flag, flag_not_set
  flag_set:
    NOP
    ...
  flag_not_set:
    NOP
    ...
```

The above BBR3 looks at value in zeropage_flag (here it's a label to an actual
zero page address) and if bit 3 of the value is *zero* the branch would be
taken to `@flag_not_set`.

Branch to LABEL if bit x of zero page address is 1 where x is the number
of the specific bit (0-7).

+c: New for the 65C02
-816: *Not available* on the 65C816  

#### BBS Example

```asm
check_flag:
    BBS3 zeropage_flag, flag_set
flag_not_set:
    NOP
    ...
flag_set:
    NOP
    ...
```

The above BBR3 looks at value in zeropage_flag (here it's a label to an actual
zero page address) and if bit 3 of the value is *zero* the branch would be
taken to `@flag_set`.

### B*cc*

Branch Instructions

```text
SYNTAX       MODE           HEX  LEN  CYCLES  FLAGS    
BCC $8080    Relative       $90   2    2/3+   -------- +p Carry Clear
BCS $8080    Relative       $B0   2    2/3+   -------- +p Carry Set
BEQ $8080    Relative       $F0   2    2/3+   -------- +p Equal: Zero bit set
BMI $8080    Relative       $30   2    2/3+   -------- +p Negative bit set
BNE $8080    Relative       $D0   2    2/3+   -------- +p Not Equal: Zero bit clear
BPL $8080    Relative       $10   2    2/3+   -------- +p Negative bit clear
BVC $8080    Relative       $50   2    2/3+   -------- +p oVerflow Clear
BVS $8080    Relative       $70   2    2/3+   -------- +p oVerflow Set
BRA $8080    Relative       $80   2    3/4+   -------- +p +c Always
```

The branch instructions take the branch when the related flag is Set (1) or
Clear (0).

When combined with CMP, this is the 6502's "IF THEN" construct.

```asm
LDA $1234  ; Reads the value of address $1234
CMP #$20   ; Compares it with the literal $20 (32)
BEQ Match  ; If they are equal, move to the label "Match".
```

The operand is a *relative* address, based on the Program Counter at the start
of the next opcode. As a result, you can only branch 127 bytes forward or 128
bytes back. However, most assemblers take a label or an address literal. So
the assembled value will be computed based on the PC and the entered value.

For example, if the PC is `$1000`, the statement `BCS $1023` will be `$B0 $21`.

`BCC` also functions as "branch less-than" (`<`) after a comparison (some
assemblers support a `BLT` macro/alias).
Similarly, `BCS` also functions as "branch greater-than-or-equal" (`>=`) after
a comparison (some assemblers support a `BGE` macro/alias).

+p: Execution takes one additional cycle when branching crosses a page boundary.

### BRK

Break: Software Interrupt

```text
SYNTAX       MODE           HEX  LEN  CYCLES  FLAGS    
BRK          Implied        $00   1     7     ---BD--- 
```

BRK is a software interrupt. With any interrupt several things happen:

1. The Program Counter is incremented by 2 bytes.
2. The new PC and flags are pushed onto the stack (pushed flags has B set on BRK).
3. The B flag is set (but only valid in stack memory flags interrupt pushed).
4. The D (Decimal) flag is cleared, forcing the CPU into binary mode.
5. The CPU reads the address from the IRQ vector at $FFFE and jumps there.

On the X16, BRK will jump out of the running program to the machine monitor.
You can then examine the state of the CPU registers and memory.

The B flag (as pushed on the stack) is used to distinguish a BRK from an NMI. An
interrupt triggered by asserting the NMI pin does not set the B flag, and so the X16
does a warm boot of BASIC, rather than jumping to MONitor.

leaving the new value in its place.

`DEC` with an operand operates on memory.

`DEX` operates on the X register  
`DEY` operates on the Y register  
`DEC A` or `DEC` operates on the Accumulator.

- Sets N (Negative) flag if the two's compliment value is negative

```

Perform an exclusive OR of the given value in A
(the accumulator), storing the result in A.

The exclusive OR version of [ORA](#ora).

- Sets N (Negative) flag if the two's compliment value is negative
- Sets Z (Zero) flag is the value is zero

Exclusive OR returns a 1 bit for each bit that is different in the values
tested. It returns a 0 for each bit that is the same.

`EOR #$00` has no effect on A, but still sets the Z and N flags.  
`EOR #$FF` inverts the bits in A.

### JMP

Jump to new address

```text

JMP $8080,X  Absolute,X     $7C   3     6     -------- +c
```

Jump to specified memory location and begin execution from this point.

Note for indirect jumps: The CPU does not correctly retrieve the second byte
of the pointer from the next page, so you should never use a pointer address
on the last byte of a page. ie: $12FF. *[Issue is fixed on 65C02]*

+c: New for the 65C02  

#### (Absolute,X) and Jump Tables

(Absolute,X) is an additional mode for the 65C02 and is commonly used for
implementing jump tables.

So we might have something like:

```asm
important_jump_table:
  .word routine1
  .word routine2
...

LDX #$02     ; table index * 2
JMP (important_jump_table,x)
```

The above would jump to the address of `routine2`, and is much faster than
the old 6502 method of pushing the two bytes onto the stack and performing
an RTS.

Stores the address of the Program Counter to the stack.  
Jump to specified memory location and begin execution from this point.  

This is used to run subroutines in user programs, as well as running KERNAL
routines. RTS is used at the end of the routine to return to the instruction
immediately after the JSR.

Be careful to always match JSR and RTS, as imbalanced JSR/RTS operations will
either overflow or underflow the stack.

### NOP

No Operation

```text
SYNTAX       MODE           HEX  LEN  CYCLES  FLAGS    
NOP          Implied        $EA   1     2     -------- 
```

NOP simply does nothing for 2 clock cycles. No registers are affected, and no
memory reads or writes occur. This can be used to delay the clock by 2 ticks.

It's also a useful way to blank out unwanted instructions in memory or in
a machine language program on disk. By changing the byte values of the opcode
and operands to $EA, you can effectively cancel out an instruction.

It is also useful for adding small delays to your code. For instance, to add a
bit of delay when writing to the YM2151 chip (see [Chapter 11 - YM Write Procedure](X16%20Reference%20-%2011%20-%20Sound%20Programming.md#vera-psg-and-pcm-programming)).

ORA ($20)    ZP Indirect    $12   2     5     N-----Z- +c
```

Perform a logical OR of the given value in A
(the Accumulator), storing the result in A.

- Sets N (Negative) flag if the two's compliment value is negative
- Sets Z (Zero) flag is the value is zero

`OR #$00` has no effect on A, but still sets the Z and N flags.  
`OR #$FF` results in $FF.

| M | A | Result |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | 1      |
| 1 | 0 | 1      |

PHY          Implied        $5A   1     3     -------- +c
```

Pushes a register to the stack.

This instruction copies the value in the affected register to the address
of the stack pointer, then moves the stack pointer downward by one byte.

Be careful to match Push and Pull operations so that you don't accidentally
overflow or underflow the stack.

PHP pushes the Flags, also called P for Program Status Register.

The corresponding "Pull" instructions are [PLA](#pla), [PHP](#pla), [PHX](#pla),
and [PHY](#pla).

PLY          Implied        $7A   1     4     N-----Z- +c
```

Pulls a value from the stack into a register.

This instruction moves the stack pointer up by one byte, then copies the value
from the address of the stack pointer to the affected register.

Be careful to match Push and Pull operations so that you don't accidentally
overflow or underflow the stack.

PLP pulls the Flags, also called P for Program Status Register.

Use TXS or TSX to directly manage the stack pointer.

RTI          Implied        $40   1     6     -------- 
```

Return from an interrupt by popping three values off the stack.
The first is for the status register (P) followed by the two bytes of the
program counter.

Note that unlike [RTS](#rts), the popped address is the actual
return address (rather than address-1).

SBC ($20)    ZP Indirect    $F2   2     5     NV----ZC +c
```

Subtract the operand from A and places the result in A.

When Carry is 0, an additional 1 is subtracted.

There is no "Subtract without carry". To do that, use SEC first to set the Carry
flag.

If D=1, subtraction is Binary Coded Decimal. If D=0 then subtraction is binary.

C is clear when result is less than 0. (ie: Borrow took place)  
Z is set when result is zero  
V is set when signed result goes below -128 or above 127.  
N is set when result is negative (bit 7=1)  

+p: Add 1 cycle if a page boundary is crossed when forming address.

SED          Implied        $F8   1     2     ----D--- 
```

Sets the Decimal flag. This will put the CPU in BCD mode, which affects the
behavior of ADC and SBC.

In binary mode, adding 1 to $09 will set the Accumulator to $0F.  
In BCD mode, adding 1 to $09 will set the Accumulator to $10.  

Using BCD allows for easier conversion of binary numbers to decimal. BCD also
allows for storing decimal numbers without loss of precision due to power-of-2
rounding.

TRB $8080    Absolute       $1C   3     5     ------Z- +c
```

Effectively an inverted AND between memory and the Accumulator. The bits that
are 1 in the Accumulator are set to 0 in memory.

- Sets Z (Zero) flag if all bits from the AND are zero.

+c: New for the 65C02

#### TRB Example

```asm
          ; Assume location $20 has a value of $11.
LDA #$01  ; Load a bit mask of 0000 0001
TRB $20   ; Apply the mask and reset bit 0
          ; Location $20 now has a value of $10.
```

This is conceptually similar to

```asm
LDA #$01 ; We want to clear bit 1 of the data
EOR #$FF ; Invert the mask, so $01 becomes $FE (1111 1110)
AND $20  ; AND with memory, saving the result in .A
STA $20  ; Store it back to memory.

TSB $8080    Absolute       $0C   3     5     ------Z- +c
```

Performs an OR with each bit in the accumulator and memory.
Each bit that is 1 in the Accumulator is set to 1 in memory. This is similar to
an ORA operation, execpt that the result is stored in memory, not in A.

The Z flag is set based on the final result of the operation, ie: the memory
data is 0.

TXS          Implied        $9A   1     2     -------- Copy from .X to Stack Pointer
```

Copies data from one register to anohter.

TSX and TSX copy between the Stack Pointer and the X register. This is the only
way to directly control the Stack Pointer. To initialize the Stack Pointer to
a specific address, you can use the following instructions.

### WAI

Wait

WAI          Implied        $CB   1     3     -------- +c
```

Effectively stops the processor until a hardware interrupt occurs. The intterupt
is processed immediately, and execution resumes in the Interrupt handler.

NMI, IRQ, and RST (Reset) will recover from the WAI condition.

Normally, an instruction completes its operation before actually handling an
interrupt. But if WAI has executed, the CPU does not need to defer the
interrupt, and so the interrupt can be handled immediately.

## Status Flags

Flags are stored in the P register. PHP and PLP can be used
to directly manipulate this register. Otherwise the flags
are used to indicate certain statuses and changed by
various instructions.

P-Register:

`NV1B DIZC`

  N = Negative  
  V = oVerflow  
  1 = Always 1  
  B = Interrupt Flag  
  D = Decimal Mode  
  I = Interupts Disabled  
  Z = Zero  
  C = Carry

.endmacro

.macro smb bit, destination
 lda #$1 << bit
 tsb destination
.endmacro
```
