# Appendix x: Getting Started

## Finding and starting programs 

When starting your Commander X16, you'll notice that it's not like other computers. There is no GUI, and command line commands like "DIR" don't get you anywhere. Here are some quick tips to getting started:

**DOS "$"** or **@$** 

This will list the files in the current directory on your SD card (or the directory selected with -fsroot, if you're using the emulator.)

Other options:

`@$=D` to list _directories_ in the current directory

`@$=T` lists files with their timestamps.

**DOS "CD:directory"** or **@CD:directory**

Changes to a new directory. This is similar to the CD command in DOS, Linux, and MacOS. 

**LOAD "filename"** or **/filename**

Loads the file named "filename". This will load BASIC programs to the default load address of 2049 (or $801). You can run the program with the `RUN` command

**RUN** 

Runs the currently loaded program
