As a modern sibling of the line of Commodore home computers, the Commander X16 is reasonably compatible with computers of that line.

* Pure BASIC programs are fully backwards compatible with the VIC-20 and the C64.
* POKEs for video and audio are not compatible with any Commodore computer. (There are no VIC or SID chips, for example.)
* Pure machine language programs (\$FF81+ KERNAL API) are compatible with Commodore computers.
