### SNES Ports

The computer contains two SNES style ports and will work with Super Nintendo compatible game pads. 

<img src="images/SNES_Controller_Female.svg" alt-text="SNES Controller Port" width="256" />

| Pin # | Description | Wire Color
|-------|-------------|-------------
| 1 | +5v | White
| 2 | Data Clock | Yellow/Red
| 3 | Data Latch | Orange
| 4 | Serial Data | Red/Yellow
| 5 | N/C | -
| 6 | N/C | -
| 7 | Ground | Brown

The Data Clock and Data Latch are generated by the computer and can be shared between the two ports. The Serial Data line is unique per controller.

### IEC Port

The IEC port is a female 6 pin DIN 45322 connector. The pinout and specifications are the same as the Commodore 128 computer, with the required lines for Fast IEC, as used by the 1571 and 1581 diskette drives. 1541 drives are also compatible, using standard IEC mode at 3200 bits/sec.

|Pin | Description	| Signal direction	| Remark
|----|--------------|-------------------|--------------
| 1  | SERIAL SRQ   | IN                | Serial Service Request In, at the C128 "Fast Serial Clock"
| 2	 | GND	        | -	                | Ground, signal ground (0V)
| 3	 | SERIAL ATN	| OUT               | Attention, for the selection of a device at beginning/end of a transmission
| 4	 | SERIAL CLK	| IN/OUT	        | Clock (for data transmission)
| 5	 | SERIAL DATA	| IN/OUT	        | Data
| 6	 | SERIAL RESET	| OUT(/IN)	        | Reset 

The IEC protocol is beyond the scope of this document. Please see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_bus) for more information. 

### PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse

### Expansion Ports

The expansion ports can be used for ROM cartridges or I/O modules and contain the full CPU address and data bus, plus the ROM bank select lines, stereo audio, and 5 IO select lines. 

The expansion/cartridge port is a 60 pin edge connector with 2.54mm pitch. Pin 1 is in the rear-left corner.

To simplify address decoding, pins IO3-IO7 are active for specific, 32-byte address ranges. 

| Address     | Description 
|-------------|------------------
| $9F60-$9FFF | Expansion port I/O range
| $9F60-$9F7F | IO3
| $9F80-$9F9F | IO4
| $9FA0-$9FBF | IO5
| $9FC0-$9FDF | IO6
| $9FE0-$9FFF | IO7

Expansion boards should allow the user to select their desired I/O bank with jumpers or DIP switches, to prevent conflicts with other devices. 

SCL and SDA pins are shared with the i2c connector on j9 and can be used to access i2c peripherals on cartridges or expansion cards. 

ROMB0-ROMB7 are connected to the ROM bank latch at address $01. Values 0-31 ($00-$1F) address the on-board ROM chips, and 32-255 are itended for expansion ROM or RAM chips. This allows for a total of 3.5MB of address space in the $C000-FFFF address range. 

AUDIO_L and AUDIO_R are routed to the J10, the audio option header. 

The other pins are connected to the system bus and directly to the 65C02 processor. 

### ATX Power Supply

This is an industry standard 20-pin ATX power connector. You don't need an expensive power supply, but it must supply the -12v rail. Not all do, so check your unit to make sure. If you can't tell from the label, you can check Pin 12 and COM. If the clip side is facing away from you, pin 12 will be the second pin on the left on the clip side.

The Commander does not use the 4-pin CPU power, GPU power, 4-pin drive power, or SATA power connectors. 

To save space, when running a bare motherboard, we recommend a "Pico PSU" power supply, which derives all of the necessary power lines from a single 12V source. 


### J1 ROM Write Protect

Remove J1 to write protect system ROM. With J1 installed, users can program the system ROM using an appropriate ROM flash program. 


### J2 NMI

Connect a button here to generate an Non Maskable Interrupt (NMI) on the CPU. This will execute a BASIC warm start, which will stop any existing program, clear the screen, and print the READY prompt.


### J3 (Unknown)

Connect J8 for LPT Compat. (TODO: Is this the Centronics parallel port mode Lorin hinted at early on?)

Next to the audio header is a set of jumer pads, JP1-JP6. Cutting these traces allows you to extract isolated audio from each of the system devices: VERA's PSG oscillators, the FM syntheizers (L and R) and audio devices connected to the expansion ports.

### VGA Connector

<img src="images/VGA_Port.svg" width="256" alt-text="VGA Connector" />

| Pin | Desc      |
|-----|-----------|
| 1   | RED
| 2   | GREEN
| 3   | BLUE 
| 4   | 
| 5   | GND
| 6   | RED_RTN   
| 7   | GREEN_RTN

| 9   | 
| 10  | GND
| 11  | 
| 12  |
| 13  | HSync
| 14  | VSync
| 15  |


The VGA connector is a female [DE-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature#Description,_nomenclature,_and_variants) jack. 

The video resolution is 640x480 60FPS progressive scan, RGB color, and separated H/V sync. (TODO: does VGA go to 15KHz when interlace mode is turned on?) VGA signals are 0-1V analog. The VGA connector will not drive a CGA or RGBI monitor.

VERA does not use the ID/DDC lines.


### Composite Connector

The Composite video is a standard RCA connector. Center pin carries signal. Sheild is signal ground.

The signal is NSTSC Composite baseband video.

The video is 480 lines 60Hz interlaced. (TODO confirm:) Composite is not available when VGA is running at 60Hz progressive scan.


### S-Video Connector

<img src="images/s_video.svg" width="128" alt-text="S-Video Connector" />

| Pin | Desc      |                       |
|-----|-----------|-----------------------|
| 1   | GND (Y)   |                       |
| 2   | GND (C)   |                       |
| 3   | Y         | Intensity (Luminance) |
| 4   | C         | Color (Chrominance)   |

The connector is a 4-pin Mini-DIN connector. While the same size as a PS/2 connector, the PS/2 connector has a plastic key at the bottom. Do not attempt to plug a keyboard or mouse into the S-Video port, or bent pins will occur.

The signal is NTSC baseband Y/C separated video. S-Video provides better resolution than composite, since the color and intensity are provided on separate pins. you can use a splitter cable to separate the Y and C signals to drive a Commodore 1702 or compatible monitor. 

The video is 480 lines 60Hz interlaced. (TODO confirm:) Composite is not available when VGA is running at 60Hz progressive scan.

This requires an EEPROM programmer and an interface board to program. See chapter 13 for the programming adapter and instructions.
