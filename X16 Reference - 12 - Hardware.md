### VERA Connectors

### SNES Ports

The computer contains two SNES style ports and will work with Super Nintendo compatible game pads.

| Pin # | Description | Wire Color
|-------|-------------|-------------
| 1 | +5v | White
| 2 | Data Clock | Yellow/Red
| 3 | Data Latch | Orange
| 4 | Serial Data | Red/Yellow
| 5 | N/C | -
| 6 | N/C | -
| 7 | Ground | Brown

The Data Clock and Data Latch are generated by the computer and can be shared between the two ports. The Serial Data line is unique per controller.

### IEC Port

The IEC port is a female 6 pin DIN 45322 connector. The pinout and specifications are the same as the Commodore 128 computer, with the required lines for Fast IEC, as used by the 1571 and 1581 diskette drives. 1541 drives are also compatible, using standard IEC mode at 4800 bits/sec.

|Pin | Description	| Signal direction	| Remark
|----|--------------|-------------------|--------------
| 1  | SERIAL SRQ   | IN                | Serial Service Request In, at the C128 "Fast Serial Clock"
| 2	 | GND	        | -	                | Ground, signal ground (0V)
| 3	 | SERIAL ATN	| OUT               | Attention, for the selection of a device at beginning/end of a transmission
| 4	 | SERIAL CLK	| IN/OUT	        | Clock (for data transmission)
| 5	 | SERIAL DATA	| IN/OUT	        | Data
| 6	 | SERIAL RESET	| OUT(/IN)	        | Reset 

The IEC protocol is beyond the scope of this document. Please see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_bus) for more information. 

### PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse

| Pin | Name  | Description
|-----|-------|-------------
| 1   | +DATA | Data 
| 2	  | NC    | Not connected
| 3	  | GND	  | Ground
| 4	  | Vcc	  | +5 VDC
| 5	  |+CLK	  | Clock
| 6	  | NC    | Not Connected

### Expansion Ports

The expansion ports can be used for ROM cartridges or I/O modules and contain the full CPU address and data bus, plus the ROM bank select lines, stereo audio, and 5 IO select lines. 

The expansion/cartridge port is a 60 pin edge connector with (todo) spacing. Pin 1 is located closest to the rear of the PCB.

Pins IO3-IO7 should be active when the CPU addresses specific ports in the External Address I/O range. That range extends from $9F60-$9FFF. 

| Address     | Description 
|-------------|------------------
| $9F60-$9FFF | External device block
| $9F60-$9F7F | IO3
| $9F80-$9F9F | IO4
| $9FA0-$9FBF | IO5
| $9FC0-$9FDF | IO6
| $9FE0-$9FFF | IO7

This simplifies address decoding, as you only need to decode address lines 0-4. 

**Implementation Note**: I/O ports are shared across all 4 slots, and users will likely use more than one card at the same time. To avoid conflicts, I/O cards should allow the user to select the block(s) the card uses. We suggest using DIP switches or jumpers to route the corresponding IO line to your chips' CS pins. 

### User Port Header

By default, the User Port is not routed to a port on the back of the computer. This allows you the greatest flexibility in connecting devices inside or outside your enclosure.

### ATX Power Supply

This is an industry standard 20-pin ATX power connector. You don't need an expensive power supply, but it must supply the -12v rail. Not all do, so check your unit to make sure. If you can't tell from the label, you can check Pin 12 and COM. If the clip side is facing away from you, pin 12 will be the second pin on the left on the clip side.

The Commander does not use the 4-pin CPU power, GPU power, 4-pin drive power, or SATA power connectors. 

To save space, when running a bare motherboard, we recommend a "Pico PSU" power supply, which derives all of the necessary power lines from a single 12V source.
