## Update instructions


### Step 1: Note down your current ROM/SMC/VERA versions (recommended)

#### 1.1 ROM/SMC/VERA versions
Use the `HELP` command to see which versions you currently have.
You may want to take a picture of the screen or write it down, for future reference.

#### 1.2 SMC bootloader version
- Poll bootloader version with this command: `PRINT I2CPEEK($42,$8E)`
	- This should be 2 if you have a stock PR board. Note that if you have bootloader 3 it may incorrectly display as 255.
- If you have SMC version 47.2.3 or later, you can use the tool "SMCBLD7.PRG" inside [smc tools] (see step 3) to identify bootloader version based on its CRC-16 checksum, making this a more accurate bootloader test.
- Take a picture of the screen, for future reference.


### Step 2: Take a backup of what you have

#### 2.1 SD card (highly recommended)
- Plug SD card in your PC and make a backup of all files. In case SD card gets corrupted, damaged, or you loose your files otherwise.
- If needed, you can download the latest version of the SD card bundle here: https://github.com/cx16forum/sdcard

#### 2.2 ROM/SMC/VERA (optional)
- If you know your current version numbers (step 1), and do not care about rolling back, you can safely skip this step.
- If you like to preserve the history, you can optionally dump the existing versions of ROM/SMC/VERA, for your own archival purposes. In particular, if your version is not a released full version (e.g. ROM prerelease), you may want to make a backup of this one (and give a heads-up on Discord, #kernel).

##### 2.2.1 ROM (optional)
If your ROM version is marked as release (and not prerelease), and your version is present in the ROM release page https://github.com/X16Community/x16-rom/releases/ , you can likely download your version from the release page should you ever want to roll back. If your version is marked as Prerelease (e.g. 8929A57+ or 33ACE3A4), it is harder to be certain that you can roll back, as those are not official releases. There exist a dump of a 8929A57+ ROM here: https://cx16forum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=31112 , although, in theory, there can exist different ROM versions with this number.

Should you want to make a backup of your ROM (which is entirely optional), you can use any of the following tools:
- https://cx16forum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=31112 (slow, inconvenient, but maybe safer)
- https://discord.com/channels/547559626024157184/549248089379307522/1292106222509756427 (fast, convenient, maybe less safe in terms of SD card)

##### 2.2.2 SMC (optional)
If your SMC version is present on the release page https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/releases/ , you can download it from there if you want to roll back. The 45.1.0 release can be downloaded from here https://github.com/FlightControl-User/x16-flash/releases/download/r3.0.0/R45-BINS.zip . All bootloader versions are present in the [smc tools] bundle.

Should you want to dump your SMC, for archival purposes:
- If your SMC version is 47.2.3 or newer, you can dump your SMC using SMCDMP8.PRG inside [smc tools].  https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/pull/53#issuecomment-2362330198
- If your SMC version is older, and you want to make a backup, you need an external programmer/Arduino:
	- Fully disconnect power supply
	- Carefully remove SMC from socket
	- Connect SMC to programmer/Arduino ( https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/blob/main/doc/recovery-with-arduino.md )
	- Use this command to dump flash: `avrdude -cstk500v1 -pattiny861 -P<yourport> -b19200 -Uflash:r:smc-dump.hex:i`

##### 2.2.3 VERA (optional)
- VERA releases can be downloaded from here https://github.com/X16Community/vera-module/releases/ .
- If you want to dump your VERA, you have two options:
	- Wait for someone to make a VERA dumper (or make one yourself)
	- Connect using an external programmer and dump it (not documented yet)
- Note that, if VERA have been programmed using the "x16-flash" tool, the tool will have removed the first 32 bytes of the file. This tool expects there to be a custom 32 byte header in front of the bitstream file, which is not present in the releases. Luckily, this is not a problem for release "0.1.1", "0.3.1", "0.3.2" and "47.0.2" (all current releases), as these start with a ~54 bytes unimportant header before a preamble. Still, because of this, it is recommended to use FLASHVERA instead of x16-flash to update VERA.

### Step 3: Download files and place on SD card

- BIN files and their associated programming tool must stay in the same folder
- Note that the x16-flash tool (UPDATE.PRG) will attempt to program both ROM, SMC and VERA if it finds associated .BIN files in its folder, so make sure that its folder only contains ROM.BIN

#### Suggested folder structure:
- UPDATE
	- VERA
		- 47.0.2
			- FLASHVERA.PRG
			- VERA.BIN
	- ROM
		- R48
			- UPDATE.PRG
			- ROM.BIN
	- SMC
		- 47.2.3
			- SMCUPDATE.PRG
	- SMCTOOLS
		- SMCBLD7.PRG
		- SMCBLW19.PRG
		- BOOT3.BIN

#### Downloads:
- VERA 47.0.2
	- https://github.com/X16Community/vera-module/releases/tag/v47.0.2
		- Download Assets -> VERA_47.0.2.BIN and FLASHVERA.PRG
- ROM R48
	- https://github.com/X16Community/x16-rom/releases/tag/r48
		- Download Assets -> Release.R48.ROM.Image.zip
			- Extract "rom.bin"
	- https://github.com/FlightControl-User/x16-flash/releases/tag/r3.0.0
		- Download Assets -> CX16-UPDATE-R3.0.0.PRG
- SMC 47.2.3
	- https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/actions/runs/10988514867
		- Download Artifacts -> "SMC default firmware" (NOT the custom CommunityX16)
			- Extract "SMCUPDATE-47.2.3.PRG"

		- Download smc-flash-manipulation-6.zip
			- Extract files mentioned under SMCTOOLS above

#### Copy to SD card
- Prepare the folder structure on the SD card.
- Copy downloaded files to SD card, inside the folder structure mentioned above.
- Rename files as needed. Uppercase/lowercase is not important.

#### Navigating the file system on X16
- To list files in current folder, or change folder, you use the commands `DOS"$"` or `DOS"CD:folder"`.
- A shortcut is to use the `@` prefix, e.g. `@$` and `@CD:folder`
- To enter the VERA folder, you can e.g. use the command `@CD:/UPDATE/VERA/47.0.2`
- You can also navigate like this:

```
@CD:/UPDATE
@$
@CD:VERA
@$
@CD:47.0.2
@$
```

### Step 4: Update VERA to 47.0.2
VERA have best backward compatibility, and should be flashed first.
- 47.0.2 supports at least ROM 47 prerelease, and probably older ROMs as well.
- Release page: https://github.com/X16Community/vera-module/releases/tag/v47.0.2
- Follow instructions on release page to program VERA.

```
@CD:/UPDATE/VERA/47.0.2
LOAD "FLASHVERA.PRG"
RUN
```

- After programming, restart machine and type `HELP` to verify VERA version.

### Step 5: Update ROM to R48
- Minimum SMC version: 43.0.0
- Minimum VERA version: 0.3.1
- You may follow this guide: https://github.com/FlightControl-User/x16-flash

```
@CD:/UPDATE/ROM/R48
LOAD "UPDATE.PRG"
RUN
```

- Follow the instructions on screen.
- Note that the J1 jumper must be on, to allow ROM to be reprogrammed. Disconnect jumper after programming, to ensure ROM is write protected.
- Important: Only program ROM in this step, not VERA or SMC.


### Step 6: Update SMC to 47.2.3
- To update SMC, a little program on the SMC called "bootloader" is used to replace its main program.
- All PR boards up to ~900 seem to have been delivered with version 45.1.0, and with a bootloader which claims to be version 2, but, unfortunately, is a corrupt version of version 2 (also referred to as the "bad" bootloader). This have the consequence that, if you attempt to program, the x16 will hang at the end of programming. If you attempt to fix the hang problem by disconnecting power, and plug it back in, your SMC will be "bricked", and you cannot use your x16 until you disconnect the SMC and program it manually using an external programmer or Arduino [recovery-with-arduino].
- To update your SMC with bad bootloader, you have 2 options:
	- Option 1: Disconnect the SMC, connect to an external programmer, and install latest firmware https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/blob/main/doc/recovery-with-arduino.md
	- Option 2: Reset the SMC by shorting its reset pin to GND, using a jumper wire. Instruction: https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/blob/main/doc/update-with-bad-bootloader-v2.md
		- NB: If you plan to do option 2, ref the instructions, you should practice doing this reset while at the READY prompt. Once you get the hang of it, you can do it during programming. It is important that you get it correct at the critical moment when the SMC is hanging inside the bad bootloader.
- If you have a different SMC version than 45.1.0, you most likely do not have the bad bootloader.

#### Recommended install method, SMCUPDATE-47.2.3.PRG
- The recommended method to upgrade SMC to latest version 47.2.3, is to use an installer with version 47.2.3 bundled together with the installer.
- Note that this version is currently not inside an official release
- If there is a risk of having the bad v2 bootloader, have a jumper wire ready
- Load and run the installer
```
@CD:/UPDATE/SMC/47.2.3
LOAD "SMCUPDATE.PRG"
RUN
```
- Use the jumper wire if needed, ref the "update-with-bad-bootloader-v2.md" instructions

#### Alternative tools
- The tool SMCUPDATE 2.0 allows you to specify a .hex file to install
	- This tool works with bootloader 2, but not with bootloader 3
	- Tool: https://github.com/stefan-b-jakobsson/x16-smc-update/releases/tag/2.0
	- When prompted for file name, enter "x16-smc.ino.hex"
- The tool x16-flash allows you to program the .bin file from the release page
	- This tool ignores bootloader version, and works with both v2 and v3
	- If bootloader version is 2, you cannot reprogram with the same version
	- This tool gives bad recommendation in the case of bad bootloader
	- Tool: https://github.com/FlightControl-User/x16-flash/releases/tag/r3.0.0
- These tools can work with the .hex and .bin files found in the release page
	- https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc/releases/tag/r47.2.3


### Step 7: Install bootloader v3
Follow instructions inside the text file in [smc tools] ("smc-flash-manipulation-6.zip")

- Run SMCBLD7.PRG to get bootloader checksum, version and failsafe status
```
@CD:/UPDATE/SMCTOOLS
LOAD "SMCBLD7.PRG"
RUN
```
- Run SMCBLW19.PRG to install BOOT3.BIN
```
@CD:/UPDATE/SMCTOOLS
LOAD "SMCBLW19.PRG"
RUN
```
- Run SMCBLD7.PRG to validate checksum again, confirm it BF63 (v3)
- To install "Boot v3 failsafe", you need to update SMC a second time (repeat step 6)
- Run SMCBLD7.PRG, to confirm that boot v3 failsafe is installed

With Boot V3 failsafe installed, you have a fallback mechanism in case SMC firmware gets corrupted.

## Appendix: How to downgrade from latest release to first release

### Step 1: Downgrade bootloader
This is optional, as all bootloaders are backward compatible. If you do not plan to downgrade bootloader, go to step 2.

Run SMCBLD7.PRG. Check if "Boot v3 failsafe" is installed. If it is, and you plan to downgrade to bootloader v2 or older, you must:
- Ensure [any working SMC programming tool and SMC version] is present on SD card
	- SMCUPDATE-47.2.3 can be used
	- NB: x16-flash with bootloader 2 rejects programming SMC to the same version!
- Downgrade bootloader, using SMCBLW19.PRG
- Computer is now in a critical state. If you power it off, it is bricked.
